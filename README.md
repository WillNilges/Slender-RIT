# Slender-RIT
Graduation day. Your name is called. You walk up to the stage.

There he is. Munson. Your diploma in hand. Finally. After 5 long years of Computer Science schooling, your degree is only another 10 feet away. You eagerly approach Munson, beaming, holding out your hand for his.

He's much taller in person. He stares down at you, grinning as well. He firmly takes your hand, giving you a hearty shake, then, slowly, with his left hand, angles the diploma down into your hand. You blink.

And suddenly, you aren't where you were. The stage is gone. It's pitch black. Where are you?

Munson's booming voice interrupts your panicked thoughts.

"You have completed Phase 1. Prepare for Phase 2."

"_No._" you mouth, soundlessly. You have found yourself in front of Gracies. It's the middle of the night, and you can't help but feel that someone, or something, is watching you.

"Collect the artifcats. Eight in all."

You have a feeling this is going to be a long night...
